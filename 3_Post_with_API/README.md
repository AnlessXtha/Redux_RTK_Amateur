- ## createAsyncThunk

  `createAsyncThunk` is a function provided by the Redux Toolkit, a library that simplifies Redux usage. This function helps streamline the process of handling asynchronous actions in Redux. It creates an action creator that generates three action types: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. These correspond to the different stages of an asynchronous operation (e.g., API call). It allows developers to write asynchronous logic in a more organized and readable way by separating the handling of asynchronous actions into a single thunk. This enhances code maintainability and reduces boilerplate code in Redux applications.

  ### Purpose:

  The primary purpose of `createAsyncThunk` is to simplify the process of dealing with asynchronous actions in a Redux application. It helps manage the boilerplate code associated with asynchronous operations and enhances code readability.

  ### Syntax:

        createAsyncThunk(typePrefix, payloadCreator, options)

  - typePrefix (string): A string that serves as the prefix for the three action types generated by `createAsyncThunk`.

  - payloadCreator (function): A function that returns a `Promise`. This function is responsible for the asynchronous logic and resolving or rejecting the Promise which will determine the outcome of the action.

  - options (object): An optional object that allows you to configure various aspects of the async thunk, such as conditionally dispatching actions, serializing arguments, or defining extraReducers.

  ### Example:

        import { createAsyncThunk } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

        const fetchUserData = createAsyncThunk('user/fetchUserData', async (userId, thunkAPI) => {
            const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
            return response.json();
        });
