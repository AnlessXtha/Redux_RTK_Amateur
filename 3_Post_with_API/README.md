- ## createAsyncThunk

  `createAsyncThunk` is a function provided by the Redux Toolkit, a library that simplifies Redux usage. This function helps streamline the process of handling asynchronous actions in Redux. It creates an action creator that generates three action types: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. These correspond to the different stages of an asynchronous operation (e.g., API call). It allows developers to write asynchronous logic in a more organized and readable way by separating the handling of asynchronous actions into a single thunk. This enhances code maintainability and reduces boilerplate code in Redux applications.

  ### Purpose:

  The primary purpose of `createAsyncThunk` is to simplify the process of dealing with asynchronous actions in a Redux application. It helps manage the boilerplate code associated with asynchronous operations and enhances code readability.

  ### Syntax:

        createAsyncThunk(typePrefix, payloadCreator, options)

  - typePrefix (string): A string that serves as the prefix for the three action types generated by `createAsyncThunk`.

  - payloadCreator (function): A function that returns a `Promise`. This function is responsible for the asynchronous logic and resolving or rejecting the Promise which will determine the outcome of the action.

  - options (object): An optional object that allows you to configure various aspects of the async thunk, such as conditionally dispatching actions, serializing arguments, or defining extraReducers.

  ### Example:

        import { createAsyncThunk } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

        const fetchUserData = createAsyncThunk('user/fetchUserData', async (userId, thunkAPI) => {
            const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
            return response.json();
        });

  ### Actions Types Generated:

  `createAsyncThunk` automatically generates three action types based on the provided `typePrefix`:

  - `${typePrefix}/pending`: This is dispatched when the async operation begins.
  - `${typePrefix}/fulfilled`: Dispatched when the async operation is successful. The result of the operation is included in the action payload.
  - `${typePrefix}/rejected`: Dispatched when the async operation fails. The error is included in the action payload.

  ### Usage in Reducers:

  To handle the actions generated by `createAsyncThunk`, you can use the `extraReducers` field when creating a slice with `createSlice` from Redux Toolkit.

  For example:

        import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

        const userSlice = createSlice({
            name: 'user',
            initialState: { data: null, status: 'idle', error: null },
            reducers: {},
            extraReducers: (builder) => {
                builder
                .addCase(fetchUserData.pending, (state) => {
                    state.status = 'loading';
                })
                .addCase(fetchUserData.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
                    state.status = 'succeeded';
                    state.data = action.payload;
                })
                .addCase(fetchUserData.rejected, (state, action) => {
                    state.status = 'failed';
                    state.error = action.error.message;
                });
            },
        });

  ### Benefits:

  - Boilerplate Reduction: `createAsyncThunk` significantly reduces the boilerplate code associated with asynchronous actions, making the codebase more concise and readable.

  - Simplified Async Logic: The separation of async logic into a dedicated thunk function enhances the clarity of code and simplifies error handling.

  - Automatic Action Type Generation: The three action types (pending, fulfilled, rejected) are automatically generated, reducing the likelihood of naming conflicts.

  In summary, `createAsyncThunk` is a powerful utility function that simplifies the handling of asynchronous operations in Redux applications, providing a clean and organized way to manage complex async logic.
